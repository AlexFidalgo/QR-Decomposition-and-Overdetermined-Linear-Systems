# QR_Decomposition

This project will solve the Overdetermined Linear Systems.

This project will implement the QR decomposition method to solve overdetermined linear systems using the Least Squares Method, with applications to some examples. 
QR factorization is more numerically stable than using the normal system for solving the problem.

The complete description of the problem can be read through the Problem.pdf file.
